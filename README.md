# The Story of the Rock

The concept of this work is to create an individualized experience based on facial expression detection technology, which was inspired by the emotion is an abstract thing around us and we constantly need to interpret it from others, especially through facial expressions, to make appropriate reactions and decisions during socialization. 

This demo is an interactive story about a rock that has multiple storylines and endings, and the audience will have different experiences based on their emotion during the time of watching, which will be the facial expression detected in this implementation.

In our conception, the rock, which represents stillness and grounding, embodies numbness and is void of any emotion. However, it transforms when it encounters different events triggered by the facial expressions of the participants. The essence of the storyline of the rock's evolving nature is to inspire hope and curiosity in people's lives. Regardless of one's current emotions, it reminds people that there is always a positive future ahead.
